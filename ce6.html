<h1>TEACHING AND LEARNING CONCLAVE 2019</h1>
<h2>February 14-15, 2019 | Radisson Blu Hotel</h2>
<h2>Addis Ababa - Ethiopia</h2>

<h3>TEACHING AND LEARNING CONCLAVE 2019</h3>

<p>Teaching and Learning Conclave dedicates to support the mission of the universities by expanding and improving experiences that prepare the students and teachers to thrive in a diverse environment. We are committed to promoting diversity by increasing awareness of and valuing the di?erences among the prospective and current leaders. As the region continues to grow and businesses expand, we are seeing huge competition for new talent and a focus on improvement in learning, which in turn is putting a spot light on all educational sectors.</p>

<p>Looking globally, the best practices are those that develop talent, growth and innovation. Increasingly, therefore, the emphasis is on executing talent, whether it is students sourcing, screening, assessment or training, necessary for achieving organizational acceleration and business goals. Educational Summit acts as a catalyst to enable all students and teachers to contribute at optimum levels towards the success of the university. We aspire to build partnerships with management at all levels of the organization to create a campus culture that values all students and teaching staffs.</p>

<p><strong>“Often, students, teachers and schools are ranked by achievement levels (for example, in the Ethiopian National Learning Assessment, which provides a check of levels against expected learning criteria. Ministry of Education
The problem with this approach, however, is that achievement is tightly linked to a student’s socio-economic status and his or her learning to date. In an observational dataset, with non-random sorting of students into schools and classrooms, there is a substantial risk that measures of learning are systematically correlated with measures of colleges and classroom inputs and processes. As a result, when attempting to understand the relationships between student performance and these inputs and processes, estimates are likely to be biased”</strong></p>
<p><strong>SURVEY – EVIDENCE FROM ETHIOPIA</strong></p>

<h3>WELCOME TO THE TEACHING AND LEARNING CONCLAVE 2019</h3>

<p>Education in Ethiopia is changing to better prepare students for careers. The country is splitting secondary education into two tracks, unified and vocational. The unified track is aimed more at university preparation while the vocational track is meant to prepare students for technical careers directly after finishing school.
Bahrain education is going under huge reform initiatives seeking to develop the education system at all levels and will begin with four main initiatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strengthening the teaching profession through improved recruitment, training and employment conditions.
</li>
<li>Improving Secondary Vocational Education aiming to bring these programs closer to the needs of the private sector.
</li>
<li>Establishment of the Bahrain Polytechnic which will offer courses in industrial aligned with the applied sciences, which will enable students to obtain professional qualifications though to degree level, with an emphasis on the development of practical skills directly applicable to the job market.
</li>
<li>Creating an Independent Quality Assurance Authority which will be responsible for conducting inspections of schools, secondary vocational institutions and universities, higher education units, and for running school level examinations.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure that Kingdom educational sectors can compete at the global stage, additional strategies need to be put in place to plug the skills gap of the workforce</p>

<h3>THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OF EDUCATION IN ETHIOPIA</h3>

<p>Ethiopia is moving towards implementing the new education system or the future structure of education in Ethiopia, which is more flexible as the student can obtain one of the provided tracks at the secondary level namely Unified Track or Vocational Track. The students that who will select the Unified Track can obtain one of the following division: Science, Literary and Commercial .The students who will select the Vocational Education Track either to obtain Technical stream  which  is  divided  into  applied or technical vocational or to obtain the apprenticeship program .The new structure will give the all the graduate the opportunity to continue their further study or to join the labor market, specially the technical school graduate as they faced difficulty if they want to obtain higher certificate.</p>

<p>Ethiopia has one of the most developed education systems in the Africa and has recently made strong advances in the use of information technology in schools, due to the advanced educational system.</p>
