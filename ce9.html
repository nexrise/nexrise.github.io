<h1>Augmented and Virtual Reality Conference 2019</h1>
<h2>April 17 & 18, 2019</h2>
<p><strong>The Ritz Carlton. Dubai – United Arab Emirates</strong></p>

<h3>Augmented Reality and Virtual reality for Training & Education</h3>
<strong>Theme:</strong> Explore the future with its endless application in the domain of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.</p>
<strong>Aim of the conference:</strong> Envision the major revolution caused by AR/VR to the future generation. Hear from the experts and get your systems and businesses fueled with the latest best.</p>
<strong>Learn how you can get digital-lifelong assistance to you schools and business using VR/AR</strong></p>
<strong>The quality of a school never exceeds the quality of teachers</strong>

<h3>Why this conference is a must for the growing education and training sectors in Dubai?</h4>
<strong>“Training and Education is not a choice it’s a need for every individual”</strong>
<p>This statement gives a strong perspective towards the applications of augmented reality and virtual reality in education and training. Now why Dubai in specific?</p>
<p>The very centralized answer to this comes from the major problem Dubai education and training system is facing, i.e. they have oversupply of schools and less supply of teachers and trainers. This leads to the need of getting digitalized way of teaching for every sector involving training. Since there may be instability in the education and training market if new schools/ companies fail, and regulators should make sure new entrants to the market have strong business plans. A strong business plan is the one that makes a change and have an good opinionated use cases on the same.</p>
<p>If we got the education and training system right, we got everything right is the moto to achieve, with the use of highly influential technologies the conference is addressing to.</p>

<h3>Conference Topic:</h3>
<h4>A qualitative approach for Education and Enterprise Training using Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.</h4>
<p>Regardless of whether you're in a classroom or lab, on a production line or on a construction site, at office or easily work at home, AR and virtual reality are reforming the path that individuals of any age learn and collaborate. Attend the conference to find out how augmented, virtual and mixed reality makes business training and education of various kinds more accessible, moderate, personalized and safe. Get understanding and motivation, and discover new opportunities to use speculation in development and high rate of receipt of vivid technologies in learning environment.</p>

<h3>Why Augmented Reality for Education and Training?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have many different ways for people to be educated and trained in regards to specific information and skills they need. These methods include classroom lectures with textbooks, computers, handheld devices, and other electronic appliances. The choice of learning innovation is dependent on individual’s access to various technologies and the infrastructure environment of the surrounding community available.</li>
<li>In a rapidly changing society where there is a great deal of available information and knowledge, adopting and applying information at the right time and right place is needed to maintain efficiency in both school and business settings. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality are the latest and yet very effective technologies that dramatically shifts the location and timing of learning and training.</li>
<li>AR has strong potential to provide both powerful contextual, on-site learning experiences and serendipitous exploration and discovery of the connected nature of information in the real world.</li>
<li>AR has been experimentally applied to both school and business environments, although not as much as classic methods of learning and training during the last two decades. In addition to that, now that the technologies that make augmented reality and virtual reality possible are much more powerful than ever before and compact enough to deliver AR experiences to not only corporate settings but also academic venues through personal computers and mobile devices, and therefore make several educational approaches with AR/VR  technologies  more feasible.</li>
<li>Also, wireless mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablet PCs, and other electronic innovations, are increasingly ushering this technology, AR/VR, into the mobile space where the AR/VR applications offer a great deal of promise, especially in learning and training.</p></ul></li>

<h3>Future of AR/VR in Training and Education</h3>
<p>Traditional education systems have been implementing the same learning models for decades. Today, trainers and teachers are standing in front of their trainee’s just like they did a hundred years ago. Education/Training is one of the few branches of work that has not experienced substantial change in the 21st century.
However, this is going to change with the emergence of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). According to a recent survey, almost 70% of parents already think that AR can drastically improve education systems. Trainers also believe that new technologies can modify and enhance the learning experience as we know it today.</p>
<p>Using AR tools or VR headsets, students will be able to experience learning in a completely new way. They can organize virtual field trips, visit historical places, conduct experiments, and test a wide range of devices. VR and AR technologies add gamification elements to classical education, making the whole process more appealing and engaging. At the same time, learning becomes more inclusive, accessible, and affordable. Soon enough, AR gadgets will be so cheap that almost everyone can use them on a daily basis.</p>
