India</h2>
<h2>Learning and Development Conclave 2018</h2>

<p>Learning and Development dedicates to support the mission of the company by expanding and improving experiences that prepare the leaders to thrive in a diverse environment. We are committed to promoting diversity by increasing awareness of and valuing the di?erences among the prospective and current leaders. As the region continues to grow and businesses expand, we are seeing huge competition for new talent and a focus on improvement of leaders, which in turn is putting a spot light on L&D departments.</p>

<p>Looking globally, the best L&D practices are those that develop talent, growth and innovation. Increasingly, therefore, the emphasis is on executing talent, whether it is candidate sourcing, assessment or training, necessary for achieving organizational acceleration and business goals. L&D acts as a catalyst to enable all employees to contribute at optimum levels towards the success of the business. We aspire to build partnerships with management at all levels of the organization to create a campus culture that values all employees.</p>

<p>“When asked about the key drivers for conducting training programs, 20% of large-sized companies felt training was the most important tool to keep abreast with industry innovations and up their skills, while 23% of the respondents agreed that training is essential to gain insights for better product development.</p>

<p>With regards to engaging with external agencies to impart training, all large corporates said they have in-house training departments and 29% have tie-ups with external agencies. In the case of mid-sized organizations, only 5% were found to have tie-ups with external training agencies and most of them had HR departments managing the training requirements of the company.</p>

<p>65% of mid-sized companies opt for leadership training: Survey</p>

<p>THE ECONOMIC TIMES – INDIA</p>


<h2>Welcome to the Learning and Development Conclave 2018</h2>

<p>As India is predicted to be the third largest economy by 2028 after the US and China, and the route for the country has been one of rapid growth. The key concern for learning professionals in India is how to accelerate L&D in an increasingly competitive economic environment.</p>

<p>89% of organizations in India are expected to increase the time and e?ort they spend on L&D of their critical workforce soon.</p>

<p>The reasons behind the high demand of L&D in the Indian economy are:</p>

<ul>
<li>India is seen as a knowledge-driven economy</li>
<li>Most Indian corporates face talent shortages</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure that Indian businesses can compete at the global stage, L&D strategies need to be put in place to plug the skills gap of the workforce</p>


<h2>Why Learning and Development?</h2>

<p>A learning and development strategy aims to meet employee learning and development needs, ensure optimal human capital development, and build the business management and leadership skills for a strong executive team into the future. When it is well-aligned with overall business objectives, a clear and well-de?ned learning and development strategy provides the blueprint to develop a talent pipeline that can deliver organizational goals.</p>

<p>The current business environment is fast-paced, demanding and constantly evolving. Global general management leaders need the skills to face ever-new situations, so their development as leaders can't be left to chance. A good learning and development strategy incorporate senior executive training, so their leadership skills are continually sharpened. Top leaders also need competent teams they can count on.</p>
