<h1 class=" text-center">National Conference on Educational Technology - Bangalore 2019</h1>
<h2 class=" text-center">THE MOST IMPORTANT NCET 2019 FOR EDUCATION IN INDIA</h2>
<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>NCET 2019 is here. Its happening in all industries, and its use across a range of education functions is growing fast.</p>
<p>On many estimates, over the next 10 years, enterprise spending on technology will increase from $200m to over $60billion.</p>
<p>Only the most nimble and adaptable companies and executives will thrive. Organizations that can rapidly sense and respond to opportunities will seize the advantage in the technology-enabled landscape. The successful strategy is to be willing to experiment and learn quickly. If managers are not ramping up experiments in the area of machine learning, they are not doing their job.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, technology won't replace managers, but managers who use AST will replace those who don’t. The AI and Machine Learning Conference is created to help business and technology executives cut through the hype and learn how they can use AS&T to create competitive advantage, drive new business opportunities and foster innovation.</p>
<p>The 2019 event features an unrivalled program of 20+ speakers including CxOs, business intelligence and data leaders and AI pioneers from world leading companies across all sectors.</p>
<p>Our audience is a who’s who of 180 senior decision makers: CIOs, CTOs, COOs, Chief Digital Offcer, Heads of Innovation, Strategy, Transformation are just some of the titles that will be in attendance.</p>
<p>The 2019 event will be bigger and better. The conference and exhibition will host over 250 attendees and 20 exhibition booths.</p>
<p>Over 1 day, we will feature 25 presentations, 6 roundtable sessions and several hours of networking.</p>
<p>We hope you can be part of India’s number one event on Applied Sciences and Technology for education.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU A SUPPLIER OF APPLIED SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS?<h3>
<ul><li>The National Conference on Educational Technology is your opportunity to get your brand “front of mind” with your target market.</li>
<li>Engage with the largest number of senior business strategy, technology and analytics leaders in India.</li>
<li>Influence purchasing decisions and create new opportunities for your organization.</li>
<li>Be part of real world discussions around smart AI challenges and opportunities.</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>WHAT IS THE NCET 2019?</h3>
<p>With the advancement in applied sciences and technology, these fields have become increasingly sophisticated and interdisciplinary related. In line with this trend, the National Conference on Educational Technology (NCET 2019) is expected to provide an international platform that allows researchers, academicians and industry experts to share and discuss their latest research, ideas, and survey reports in the theoretical and practical areas regarding all aspects of Technology and Applied Sciences. Prospective authors are welcome to submit their full papers or abstracts. All submissions to the conference will go through blind review processes by at least two independent peers.</p>
<p>NCET 2019 enables collaboration between science and technologists in the academic and industrial fields as well as international networks. The conference allows for substantial opportunities for presentation and academic discourse. In addition, poster sessions and exhibitions offer ample opportunity for information exchange among delegates and participants on a more personal level, especially for those who are looking for collaborative opportunities.</p>

<h3>KEY THEMES AT THE SUMMIT INCLUDE</h3>

<strong>“Artificial Intelligence is progessing at an incredible pace, transforming every aspect of our lives. As we move to understand and embrace. At technology, we need to shift our mindset away from automation and instead focus on building collaborative Ai to work side-by-side and empower humans in their everyday lives.”
Si Chen | Senior Manager, Strategy & Partnerships – Tencent Ai Lab & Robotics</strong>

<h3>NCET 2019 - THE BIG IDEA</h3>
<p>Intelligent machines have continued to make an ever-greater impact on the apps, services and touch points we come into contact with every day. This “revolution” of artificial intelligence is poised to change everything, and will empower companies to deliver better, smarter services with greater ease and on a broader scale than ever before.</p>
<p>We are already using voice-recognition systems, trailing driverless cars and utilizing robots to enhance customer services. The advent of certain technologies - inexpensive high-speed internet, secure cloud storage, mobility solutions and low cost devices - has allowed the imagined possibilities of the past to become reality.</p>
<p>AI is already having an impact on most industries - not only is it re-shaping the technology that companies use, but also changing how companies organize and operate their businesses. Because of AI we are beginning to see seismic advances in health, transport, banking, energy, education and many other domains. On many estimates, over the next 10 years enterprise spending on AI technology will increase from $200m to $50billion.</p>
<p>Clearly, the AI revolution is here - but we’ve only scratched the surface on what’s to come. AI will increasingly transform the way we live and work. It’s the businesses who embrace this transformation who will reap the biggest rewards as failure to adapt is far more detrimental than early adoption. The AI & Machine Learning Conference is a business focused event that will explore how AI and machine learning applications can be used to reduce costs, enhance productivity, improve customer satisfaction and increase revenue.</p>
<p>The Summit mixes high-level keynotes, cross industry case studies from local and global leaders and interactive roundtables moderated by experts.</p>

<h3>WHAT MAKES THE NCET 2019 UNIQUE?</h3>
<ul><li>India’s leading event focused on the impact of AS&T on education.</li>
<li>Visionary speakers - Local and global authorities will provide insights into key trends, opportunities and challenges.</li>
<li>Content designed for c-suite and line of business executives as well as technology and data leaders.</li>
<li>Interactive agenda with breakout sessions and roundtables providing in depth knowledge around specific applications.</li>
<li>Hands on practical workshops on “Designing collaborative AI” and “Machine Learning tools, aPIs and solutions”.</li>
<li>Leading exhibition - a showcase of 20 of the world’s leading Ai solution providers. Networking program - extensive networking program where business leaders and key decision makers can build relationships.</ul></li></p>

<strong>“EVERYTHING INVENTED IN THE PAST 150 YEARS WILL BE RE-INVENTED USING Ai AND MACHINE LEARNING WITH IN THE NEXT 15 YEARS“

<strong>“WE ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINING OF THE Ai REVOLUTION. IT’S QUICKLY BECOMING A PART OF EVERYTHING WE DO ONLINE AND BEYOND - POWERING THE CONNECTED SOCIETY. HOWEVER, IGNORANCE OF IT’S CAPABILITIES AND SOCIAL IMPACT MAY BE IT’S DOWNFALL.
THIS IS WHY EVENTS LIKE THIS ARE IMPORTANT - WE NEED AN OPEN AND OBJECTIVE DEBATE ON THE FUTURE IMPACT OF Ai”
