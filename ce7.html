<h1>VAT: National Aspects 2019</h1>
<h2>November 22, 2018 | Gulf Hotel</h2>
<h3>Kingdom of Bahrain</h3>

<h3>VAT: National Aspects 2019</h3>
<p>Bahrain has now issued its VAT Draft Law in Arabic and approved the introduction of VAT effective from 1 January 2019 at the expected standard rate of 5%
The Gulf region (including the Kingdom of Bahrain), has long been considered an attractive and low-tax environment. However, to keep up with the changing economic landscape and as part of wider development reforms, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states signed a framework agreement to introduce Value-Added Tax (VAT) on the supply of goods and services at a standard rate of 5%, in 2018. Implementing VAT will have implications for businesses and new taxpayers, both in Bahrain and abroad, directly and/or indirectly.</p>
<p>However, a broad-based VAT at a low rate is unlikely to deter investment into Bahrain, or the surrounding region, whose appeal stretches much further than its low-tax status.</p>

<strong>“The current absence of published domestic VAT legislation in Bahrain should not stop companies from getting ready as the underlying principles for VAT treatment are clear and known, whereby global indirect taxes best practice gives valuable insights.
In addition to on-going compliance, early preparation can enhance continuous cash-flow, minimize VAT impact on the company’s finances, avoid exposure in ongoing supply contracts and streamline operations to manage VAT effciently”
SURVEY – KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN</strong>

<h3>Welcome to the VAT: National Aspects 2019</h3>
<p>Given the speedy progress Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are making in rolling out their local Value-added Tax (VAT) legislation, VAT will soon be a reality and compliance formalities will start affecting businesses even before VAT goes live in Bahrain.
The introduction of VAT will introduce new revenue streams for government, encourage foreign investment and aid the diversification of the economy.</p>
<p>Yet its introduction should be seen as an organization-wide challenge: it should not be left to finance and IT functions to manage overnight. Companies should also not wait until the laws and regulations are finalized to start the process; much of the preparation should be done already.</p>
<p>We hope this conference goes some way to informing businesses across the GCC about what they need to do to be VAT compliant, given we have only few days to go before the implementation date.</p>

<h3>The Impacts on VAT in Kingdom of Bahrain</h3>
<p>The lack of preparation is a concern; companies should be using the pre-implementation period wisely to understand compliance, legal obligations and the financial risk associated with VAT. While the overwhelming majority realize it will affect their business, only a minority have a clear plan of how to effectively manage such a significant fiscal reform.</p>
<p>Tax advisors and professional accountants connected to the region have been working hard to understand the changes and help businesses navigate the transition successfully. This process needs to start now, otherwise companies could risk fines and avoidable regulatory burden.
Businesses in the GCC should urgently seek out the guidance of tax advisors and create a roadmap to make themselves VAT ready for 2018.</p>
