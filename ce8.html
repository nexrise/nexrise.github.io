<p>As a growing country, the knowledge of Augmented and Virtual Reality technology is only about 40% reported and recognized by the Malaysian. The results show that respondents are interested to learn and get to know about Augmented and Virtual Reality technology despite the lack of information and technology equipment in Malaysia.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with VR Experiences Development: The Engine</h3>
<p>The dream of experiencing different realities using virtual reality technology has been an on-going challenge for software developers for decades. Moreover, the ability to build these virtual 3D environments had proved near impossible to achieve. Nowadays, VR tech is within reach and the power of these technologies continue to grow to make virtual reality the truly engaging platform that has been craved for generations. With major tech companies such as Samsung, Google, & Sony have achieved record numbers for the VR hardware, virtual reality is providing a key opportunity for software developers to explore.</p>

<p>Augmented and Virtual Reality now in Malaysia, is the principal meeting place for the enterprise-focused AR, MR and VR community</p>
<p>Augmented reality gives a digital overlay to the real world. In order to accomplish this, AR requires less equipment than its virtual counterpart. Using just your phone, AR incorporates the environment around you while placing digital effects that you can view and interact with through your screen.  Pokémon Go and SnapChat Filters are probably the best-known examples of AR in action. Additionally, these two platforms appear to be the starting point for when all industries hit the gas on AR/VR technologies.</p>
